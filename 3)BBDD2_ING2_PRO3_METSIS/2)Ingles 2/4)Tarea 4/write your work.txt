 My first job was at Sport Club Gyms, where I started working in 2005 as a Personal Trainer. I developed customized fitness programs adapted to individual client needs and goals. I also coordinated daily gym activities and supervised facility operations.
 A few years later, I began working as a Physiotherapist. In this role, I collaborated with doctors and nursing staff in intensive care unit (ICU) settings and implemented rehabilitation protocols for critically ill patients.
